Project Overview:
We will create a weather prediction model that takes features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation as input and predicts the weather condition (e.g., rainy, sunny, cloudy). We'll use a supervised learning approach and a dataset that includes historical weather observations and corresponding weather conditions.
